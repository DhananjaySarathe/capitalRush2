          a) Users must use any money in their Account within 365 days. CAPITAL
          RUSH shall have the right to directly forfeit any such unused amount
          after 365 (three hundred and sixty-five) days with effect from 01
          April 2023 (“Effective Date”) in accordance with the below-mentioned
          terms. CAPITAL RUSH does not permit any cash withdrawal against any

          accordance with applicable law.
          <br />
          b) Account Maintenance Fees (“Maintenance Fees”)
          <br />
          As on the Effective Date, if a User’s Account is lying dormant for a
          period of 365 days, CAPITAL RUSH shall charge an Account Maintenance
          Fee to such User which shall be computed as follows.
          <br />
          i) For Deposit Account: The entire amount lying in the Deposit Account
          which shall be inclusive of any indirect taxes.
          <br />
          ii) For Winnings Account: CAPITAL RUSH will charge an upfront freezing
          fee (“Upfront Fee”) of INR X for all inactive accounts. X will be
          equal to the amount lying in the Winnings wallet of such inactive
          account subject to a maximum cap of INR 100. Amount X shall be
          inclusive of all taxes.
          <br />
          The Maintenance Fee is for defraying the technical costs involved in
          such freezing, holding any amounts in escrow for users, etc and
          CAPITAL RUSH shall not be required to provide any warning before
          charging the Account Maintenance Fees. CAPITAL RUSH shall however
          issue a tax invoice to the User while charging the Account Maintenance
          Fees to such User.
          <br />
          In case, the User’s Account continues to be dormant beyond a period of
          365 days, CAPITAL RUSH also reserves the right to charge monthly
          maintenance fees (“Monthly Maintenance Fee”) which shall be charged on
          the balance remaining in the Winnings Account of the User after
          deduction of the Upfront Fee (“Balance”). The Monthly Maintenance Fee
          shall be charged in monthly arrears starting 30 (thirty) days after
          the Capital Rush of 365 (three hundred and sixty-five) days of
          dormancy. The Monthly maintenance fee shall be equal to 8.33% of the
          Balance and shall be inclusive of all taxes. The User shall not be
          given any warning before the charge of the Monthly Maintenance Fee.
          CAPITAL RUSH shall however issue a tax invoice to the User while
          charging the Account Maintenance Fees to such User.
          <br />
          The User shall incur this Monthly Maintenance Fee until his / her
          account is re-verified by CAPITAL RUSH and unfrozen.
          <br />
          The User can unfreeze his / her account Capital Rush by logging in to
          his / her account and re-submitting KYC documents required by CAPITAL
          RUSH for re-verification of the account.
          <br />
          The User acknowledges and agrees that this measure is designed to
          prevent fraud/identity theft and is required to protect the User’s
          information and account. The Monthly Maintenance Fee is for defraying
          the technical and manpower costs involved in re-verification of the
          User’s account, holding amounts in escrow, etc.
          <br />
          In case, the User does not unfreeze his account before the Balance
          becomes nil, the User’s account will be permanently blocked. The User
          will no longer be able to access this account and information
          associated with this account, however, this would not prevent the User
          from creating a new account on CAPITAL RUSH by following the process
          listed in this Terms of Use.

          <br />
          4.5. Unless otherwise specified, payment of access fee for a
          particular CAPITAL RUSH Content entitles you to access it only once
          and any repeat access of the same content shall require you to pay the
          access fee again. We may at our sole discretion offer content that is
          available for temporary download and offline access on your CAPITAL
          RUSH Content-ready device (“Offline Content”). Such Offline Content
          once downloaded on to your CAPITAL RUSH Content-ready device may be
          accessed as many times as you wish without requiring payment of
          additional access fees. Limitations apply, including restrictions on
          the number of Offline Content per account, storage limitations of your
          CAPITAL RUSH account and / or your CAPITAL RUSH Content-ready device,
          the maximum number of CAPITAL RUSH Content-ready devices that can
          contain Offline Titles per account, the time period within which you
          will need to begin accessing Offline Titles and how long the Offline
          Titles will remain accessible. As CAPITAL RUSH Content is not
          available outside India, Offline Titles may also not be playable in
          countries outside India even though they were originally accessed,
          downloaded and stored while the user was in India.
          <br />
          <br />

          or otherwise send or transmit any material designed to interrupt,
          destroy or limit the functionality of any computer software or
          hardware or telecommunications equipment associated with the CAPITAL
          RUSH Content service, including any software viruses or any other
          computer code, files or programs. We may terminate or restrict your

          4.7. The quality of the audio or display of the CAPITAL RUSH Content
          may vary from device to device, and may be affected by a variety of
          factors, such as your location, the bandwidth available through and/or
          speed of your Internet connection. Certain enhanced audio and video
          capabilities are subject to your Internet service and device
          capabilities. Not all content may be available on enhanced audio or
          video capabilities and default audio and video settings on cellular
          networks will exclude such enhanced capabilities. You are responsible
          for all Internet access charges. Please check with your Internet
          provider for information on possible Internet data usage charges. The
          time it takes to stream the CAPITAL RUSH Content once access to such
          content is granted will vary based on a number of factors, including
          your location, available bandwidth at the time, the content you have
          selected and the configuration of your CAPITAL RUSH Content-ready
          device.

          acknowledge that the use of the service may require third party
          software that is subject to third party licenses. You agree that you

          account and is charged the access fee for the CAPITAL RUSH Content
          (the “Account Owner”) has access and control over the CAPITAL RUSH
          account and the CAPITAL RUSH Content-ready devices that are used to
          access our service and is responsible for any activity that occurs
          through the CAPITAL RUSH account. To maintain control over the account
          and to prevent anyone from accessing the account (which would include
          information on viewing history for the account), the Account Owner
          should maintain control over the CAPITAL RUSH Content-ready devices
          that are used to access the service and not reveal the password or
          details of the payment methods associated with the Deposit Wallet of
          the account to anyone.

          the information you provide to us relating to your account. We can

          protect you, Metronome Technologies Private Limited / CAPITAL RUSH or
          our partners from identity theft or other fraudulent activity.
